To study the impacts of a warming ocean on marine organisms, large-scale projections of climatic variables are crucial. Global models are of 0.25 - 1째 (~25-100 km) resolution, and not ideal to predict localized changes. We calculated 0.05째 resolution (~5 km) sea surface temperature (SST) projections, statistically downscaled using the delta method. We illustrate the shifting isotherms of the critical 21 and 28째C boundaries, which border the climatic envelope that humpback whales prefer for their breeding grounds. Results show by 2100, 35% of humpback whale breeding areas will experience SSTs above or within 1째C of current thresholds under middle-of-the-road scenario and 67% under business-as-usual.
